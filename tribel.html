          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Background</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">During my co-op term at TD Lab, I had the opportunity to work on a personal project catered towards my interests. My boss, David, gave me a topic and from there, I followed the double diamond design process and designed a solution to a problem with respect to the topic. I presented my work at the end of the term in front of the lab. The topic given was music creation collaboration applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2">Research</h1>
        </div>


        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f5 lh-title">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">To understand the problem and what’s currently out there, I performed a competitive analysis on some of the most popular mobile and web apps within the realm of music creation and collaboration. </p>
          <p class="lh-copy">The top competitors found were Bandlab, Bandhub, Kompoz, Blend and Trackd. These five applications were similar to one another but each had something unique that they brought to the table. For example, Trackd focused on simplicity, on-the-go mobile music creation whereas Blend was a more advanced application focused on music production.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f5 lh-title">PRIMARY RESEARCH</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">After learning a bit more about these apps, I decided to create a survey using Google Forms to understand my potential user base more. Below were questions that I wanted to answer.</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Do people know about music creation collaboration apps?</li>
            <li>Which apps have they heard of before?</li>
            <li>Why do people choose to use/not use music creation collaboration apps?</li>
            <li>If one were to use a music collaboration app, what would they value? </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lh-copy">I surveyed 25 musically-inclined students from various a cappella groups at the University of Waterloo which contributed to some bias in the survey, since most participants were vocalists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Personas</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">After collecting data from my survey and research, I developed two personas:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Customer Journey Mapping</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">To understand potential users even deeper, I used a customer journey map to map out how a typical user that has an app like Bandlab would interact with the app.</p>
          <img src="./assets/tribel/map.png"/>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Insights and Opportunities</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Through the persona creation, customer journey map and research, some insights were collected:</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Lots of web apps for collaboration but not many on mobile</li>
            <li>Collaboration can take different forms but there are 2 common models
              <ul>
                <li>Record your own part in your own time and contribute to a project</li>
                <li>Take another project and edit it, giving credit to the original  </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Many use subscription paying models</li>
            <li>Many people value performance over creation</li>
            <li>Most apps assume prior experience to using software - there seems to be an emphasis on music production (which makes sense)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Problem Statement</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">How might we create a convenient and fun experience for musicians of all skill levels to collaborate and/or perform music together regardless of location? </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Feature Identification</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Based on the problem statement, features were identified and sorted into three buckets: short term (important to have), medium term (nice to have) and long term. These were ranked by importance. The yellow highlighted features were the ones I decided to create mockups for.</p>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Workflows</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Here is one of three workflows I created (one workflow per feature).</p>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Prototype</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Using InVision, a prototype for the app was built. Check back later for the prototype!</p>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Future Steps</h1>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Build upon “community” aspect by incorporating features like groups</li>
            <li>Define token system (ie. how to get tokens, what else can they be used for)</li>
            <li>Look into incorporating performance aspect </li>
            <li>Gamification </li>
            <li>Collaborating real time </li>
            <li>Match and meetup with local musicians </li>
            <li>Recognizing musicians and helping them get their name out there</li>
            <li>Refine colour scheme and feel, tone of the app</li>
