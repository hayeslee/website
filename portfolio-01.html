          <h5><b>WHAT</b></h5>
          <p>In June 2017, the new 3.0 version of the AIR MILES Rewards Program mobile app was released on both iOS and Android devices. An experience map was proposed to analyse ways to improve the app in future releases. To gather information for the experience map, context chats were performed.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h5><b>HOW</b></h5>
          <p>A context chat is a UX research method where researchers can engage with users and understand important moments in a user's journey. There were 12 participants in the study and 9 questions were asked in total over the course of 3 weeks.</p>
        </div><!--/col-md-4-->
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h5><b>RESULTS</b></h5>
          <p>All collectors in the study were excited and engaged throughout the duration of the study. Many willingly shared valuable insights and personal motivations they had when using the app and program. All chat transcripts were printed out and analysed to create the experience map.</p>

          <h2 class="centered mb">Process</h2>
          <h5><b>WHAT DID WE DO?</b></h5>
          <p>We began by ideating on the questions to ask based on the objectives and questions we wanted to answer (ex. What motivates collectors to open up the app?) After each question for each day was planned out, we contacted collectors that met the criteria that we wanted to research with.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Three times a week, we would send questions to our collectors. After answering our initial questions, we asked follow up questions tailored to each collector to gain more valuable insights. This allowed us to discover unique journeys and motivations.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>We held an Experience Mapping workshop for two days and invited members of different teams (not only UX) to read through and analyse the data, finding out the experience of these collectors, what their moments of truths were and what can be done to improve their experience. "Moments of truths" were moments where the user decided to either start, stop or continue using the app.</p>
