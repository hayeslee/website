          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Background</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">As part of our third year design course, we were to take an existing traditional instrument and improve upon it. In terms of what aspect we were to improve upon, it was up to our research and process, with the one requirement being that the instrument must be augmented digitally in some way. We worked in groups of 6 and used the Google Design Sprint to kickstart our process. Then, we spent the remainder of the term creating prototypes, testing them and modifying them in the iterative design process. My group chose to redesign the cajon. Below are the steps in which we took to complete it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Choosing our Instrument</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">To choose an instrument, we decided to do some research to see what would be feasible. We voted on all the choices and chose the instrument with the majority of the group agreeing to it. Here is a list of all the final choices we had:</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Bagpipes</li>
            <li>Cajon</li>
            <li>Rainstick</li>
            <li>Drum machine extension for beatboxing</li>
            <li>Lute</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="lh-copy">We chose the cajon in the end because it was simple enough to build by the end of the term (~3 months) and there was a lot of freedom for us to improve upon it. We researched on some of the current issues with the instrument:</p>  
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Posture Problems</li>
            <li>Wrist Strain</li>
            <li>Hand injuries for beginners due to sharp corners</li>
            <li>Sound limitations</li>
            <li>Height issues</li>
          </ul>   
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Sprint Map</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">We came up with a sprint map to map out the problem and find an area to focus on. We learned that there are a plethora of issues associated with the ergonomics of a cajon.</p>
          <img src="./assets/postcajon/sprintmap.png"/>
          <p class="lh-copy">Target Event: Effective Rehearsal</p>
          <p class="lh-copy">Target User: Professional Musician</p>
          <p class="lh-copy">How might we improve the ergonomics of the cajon without removing the identity of the instrument?”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Research on Possible Solutions</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">On the second day of the Google Sprint, each member of the group brought research to share with toher members of possible things to include in our solution. We learned that a lot of products that involve physical user interactions haves similar ergonomic issues. Thus, we could draw parallels by referencing the ergonomic improvements of chairs, wrist-guards, etc... to get an idea of how the ergonomics of the cajon could be improved.</p>
          <p class="lh-copy">Then we drew possible solutions based on our research. The following components/enhancements were chosen (through a heat mapping exercise) for our low fidelity prototype (LFP):</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Back Support</li>
            <li>Adjustable Height</li>
            <li>Curved Top of Tapa (Wrist Support)</li>
            <li>Seating Cushion</li>
            <li>Adjustable Playing Surface</li>
          </ul>  
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">User Interviews and User Testing</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Concurrently, we also performed user interviews with casual cajon players as well as a professor from Wilfred Laurier University who specializes in creating instruments.</p>
          <p class="lh-copy">Some insights from the interviews</p>      
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Lower back strain when bending down to reach lower areas of the cajon</li>
            <li>Some cajons have cushions built in and it was comfortable</li>
            <li>Some wrist support would be beneficial for long period of time</li>
            <li>Does not see value in footrest</li>
            <li>Handlebars for portability would be nice</li>
            <li>Pedal/latch to change tuning/sound mid-song would be nice</li>
            <li>Cajon could have a looper - box-shape is limiting because with other drums, people add things like shakers to their feet to add to the music</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="lh-copy">In addition, we also performed some user-testing with members in our class using our LFP.</p>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Medium Fidelity Prototype (MFP)</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">As a group, we discussed about the next steps for our MFP and realized that we had to clarify our design scope and focus. We updated our requirements as follows:</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>A design that suits 5th to 95th percentile heights</li>
            <li>Enhance player’s ability to play the cajon as a solo instrument</li>
            <li>Increase ease of changing the sound of the cajon, as well as extending the range of sounds</li>
            <li>More lightweight and portable than the original cajon</li>
            <li>Improves posture of all players</li>
            <li>Reduces strain due to repetitive motion</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="lh-copy">Re-clarified Problem Statement: Develop an improved cajon that enhances the ergonomics of the playing experience with respect to posture and strain while increasing the portability and expressibility of the playing experience.</p>
          <img src="./assets/postcajon/mfp.png"/>
          <p class="lh-copy">After sketching out our plans, we started working on our MFP in the machine shop. We proposed 3 different cuts to the top surface.</p>
          <img src="./assets/postcajon/mfptop.png"/>
          <p class="lh-copy">Our first iteration involved foam boards:</p>

          <p class="lh-copy">We replaced them with cushion after user testing:</p>
