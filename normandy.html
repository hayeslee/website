          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Background</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">
          Normandy was one of the projects I worked on during my time at TD Lab. This project, a mobile app, was intended to be used as an engagement piece between the lab and anyone who is interested in learning more about what the lab is, the team at the lab, as well as projects that the lab is working on.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Problem</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">
          There are over 80000 employees working at TD and the lab team has a lean full-time team of a dozen members and ten to fifteen co-op students hired from local universities every term. Besides scattered articles, lab social media accounts and word of mouth, it is difficult to learn about TD Lab as an employee who is not working with the lab or near the lab. There is no website or digital experience to learn more about the lab, compared to a competitor such as Scotiabank, where their digital factory has its own website and provides information on their team and the work they do.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Business Objectives</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">As part of the projectâ€™s inception, business goals were provided to guide the initial direction in which the project was to go. The following are four goals that the stakeholders of the project wished to accomplish: </p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Demonstrate to market that TD authentically innovates and engages with ecosystem</li>
            <li>Enable TD Lab team to have a wholly managed and delivered offering to the app stores</li>
            <li>Expand, maintain a TD Lab network of people who can contribute to equity of innovation</li>
            <li>Underscore TD Lab and the Innovation Centre of Excellence as enterprise service resources</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb4">
          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Personas</h1>
          <h1 class="f5 lh-title">PRIMARY RESEARCH</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Online surveys and user interviews were created and performed to identify the target audiencee or the app. Through the survey, 3 personas were identified: potential hires, past employees of TD Lab (including co-ops) and current employees. In the user interviews, questions that were asked aimed to discover motivations behind using a mobile app and the level of engagement desired with TD Lab in a digital experience. </p>

          <h1 class="f5 lh-title">HIERARCHICAL TASK ANALYSIS</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Next, a hierarchical task analysis was created to discover some problems with the current way of contacting a team member.</p>

          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Requirements</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">Taking into account the research performed and the business objectives, below is a list of requirements that the app needed to fulfill.</p>
          <ul class="lh-copy">
            <li>Must be available as an iOS and Android application</li>
            <li>Must have easy navigation between sections in the app</li>
            <li>Must be secure and only accessible by certain people</li>
            <li>Must maintain some form of exclusivity </li>
            <li>Must be ready to demo by the end of the term</li>
            <li>Must leverage a physical, tangible token to interact with the app</li>
            <li>Must allow users to engage with TD Lab members</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="f2 lh-title">Design</h1>
          <p class="lh-copy">We opted for a clean, minimalistic design using standard iOS colours and elements. Colours chosen were human interface guideline standards and consistently used throughout:</p>
